							<h1>Stuart Wurtman</h1>
							<p>I study math and computer science at CSU Bakersfield.  I work with purpose and focus to understand problems.  I have found that projects are the best way to learn, and I let these projects speak for themselves.  Computers are incredible machines, they can take a small set of input rules and create a massive, complex output.  Throughout my education, career, and life, I strive to study these rules, and bend them to create a better output, one that creates a more just and equitable world.</p>

								<h2>Education</h2>
								<p>My development as a student at CSU Bakersfield has been shaped by my major and non-major coursework.  As a computer scientist, my departmental coursework has provided me with a broad understanding of computers and computation, that would have taken years to acquire through self-study.  And as student, my non-major coursework has served as an inspiration and as a moderating influence that put my coursework into perspective.</p>
								<h3>Major Coursework</h3>
								<p>My major coursework was fundamental to my development as a computer scientist.  My first semester of college, before I was a computer science major, I took a C++ programming fundamentals class.  I failed the class – a first for me – and it sparked my interest.  The subject was deep; I became constantly distracted wanting to learn AI, assembly, binary counting, etc.</p>
								<p>As I developed my skills as a programmer, my class in software engineering with (now Dr.) Nicholas Toothman taught me how to balance and prioritize work, both within a project, and within a healthy work-life balance.  Furthermore, Dr. Toothman provided an abundance of resources on software engineering, from design patterns, version control, and continuous integration, with enough details to understand the concept but much more to fill in later.</p>
								<p>After developing my understanding of a computer from the software side, and even learning to write programs in assembly language, I took a class with Dr. Alberto Cruz in computer architecture.  In this class, we learned piece-by-piece how to build a computer from NAND gates to ALUs.  After understanding these concepts, I was able to use an ARM-based lab server to write ARM assembly code for program optimization.</p>
								<p>And most recently, I have had the fortune to study artificial intelligence in a ground-up course.  This is not a study of the latest machine learning frameworks; it is a study of the most fundamental aspects of artificial intelligence.  What does it mean to learn, and how we can approach this algorithmically?  The algorithms and the ideas behind them seem straight forward, but what I find remarkable is how learning can be generalized, and how we can prevent a machine learning algorithm from memorizing the answers by separating training data from test data.</p>
								<h3>Non-Major Coursework</h3>
								<p>My non-major coursework, especially my philosophy classes have been inspirational and transformative. My first philosophy class was an introductory course in philosophy, which opened my eyes to many hot-button issues in philosophy, including the world of secular morality.  I found utilitarianist ideas particularly attractive, and by their extension I have been vegan for 3 years.  Later, my ethical reasoning course would connect the logic I knew from math and computer science, with the logic studied in philosophy, making the connection from computer science to real world issues, see Bertrand Russell.  Philosophy aside, studying art history gave me a deeper understanding of the last 1000 years of human history, namely how human thought has changed (philosophy again), and how technology has facilitated change.  This has given me great pause as I realized that the changes imposed by computers and technology is not always obvious during their development. And most importantly, I have learned to appreciate the value of a broad education.</p>

									<h2>Tidal Prediction Algorithm</h2>
									<p>Modern tidal prediction is based on harmonic analysis.  Tidal predictions are made by combining usually between 20 and 70 constituent curves.  I am learning the math behind tidal predictions and implementing an algorithm that can predict tides accurately, while remaining more space efficient than storing raw tidal prediction data, and time-efficient enough to run on wearable devices.</p>
